# FancyPantry

## Description

Often we see a individual at the grocery story walking around with their shopping list on a small paper and searching for pen’s to check off the items in their shopping cart, we are developing an app that will allow them to carry their shopping list with them with no need for paper and a pen. 

This app will allow the to easily take inventory of their home’s food supplies and the items that need to be add to the shopping list. Allowing them to then check off the item once it is in their cart or upon purchase.
